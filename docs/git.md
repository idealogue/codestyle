## Commit Message Guidelines
- Use sentence case with no full stop
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  * :lipstick: when improving the format/structure of the code
  * :racehorse: when improving performance
  * :non-potable_water: when plugging memory leaks
  * :memo: when writing docs
  * :bulb: Check out the [Emoji Cheat Sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com) for more ideas.


Example of a good commit message:
> Add svg icon assets

Example of a bad commit message:
> added a whole bunch of stuffâ€¦
