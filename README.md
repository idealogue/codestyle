A styleguide for the various languages & systems we use at Idealogue.

### Guiding principles: 

- A project should allow for quick iteration on design ideas. 
- Conventions and rules should be followed when possible to keep things readable.
- If a rule is holding you back from being creative, break it - but understand (and document) why.

### Things to do:

javascript
- Folder structure
- Frameworks / Libs
- Module management

GIT
- Rebase strategy
- Branching
- Deployment
- Alias commands
